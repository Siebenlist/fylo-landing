# Fylo Landing page with react and tailwindcss!

Hello! welcome to my project.

This is a frontendmentor challenge i found and i really enjoyed doing, there isn't much javascript involved but i got to try the reusability that comes with React, in the reviews section i made a reusable component card so that i could easily reuse them.

Nothing much to add for now, thank you for reading!
